## 🚀 Features

- **Docker-First Deployment**: Production-ready Docker setup with GPU support (recommended)
- **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI's TTS API (`/v1/audio/speech`)
- **Unlimited Custom Voices**: Automatically load any voice from a directory - just drop audio files and restart
- **Multi-Format Support**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, M4A, Opus, PCM
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time audio streaming for long-form content
- **Voice Management**: Dynamic voice loading, OpenAI voice mapping, and custom voice presets
- **Production Ready**: Health checks, error handling, CORS support, and comprehensive logging

## 📋 Quick Start

**Docker is the recommended deployment method** - it handles all dependencies, ensures consistent environments, and is production-ready.

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ncoder-ai/VibeVoice-FastAPI.git
cd VibeVoice-FastAPI

# Copy and configure environment
cp docker-env.example .env
# Edit .env - set VOICES_DIR to your voice files path

# Build and run
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

See [DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md](DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md) for detailed Docker instructions.

### Local Installation (Alternative)

For development or if you prefer bare-metal installation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ncoder-ai/VibeVoice-FastAPI.git
cd VibeVoice-FastAPI

# Run setup script
./setup.sh

# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Start server
./start.sh
```

## 🎯 API Endpoints

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints

- `POST /v1/audio/speech` - Generate speech from text (OpenAI-compatible)
- `GET /v1/audio/voices` - List all available voices

### VibeVoice-Specific Endpoints

- `POST /v1/vibevoice/generate` - Advanced generation with multi-speaker support
- `GET /v1/vibevoice/voices` - List all voices with detailed info
- `GET /v1/vibevoice/health` - Detailed health check

### Example: Generate Speech

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "input": "Hello, this is a test of the VibeVoice API",
    "voice": "alloy",
    "response_format": "mp3"
  }' \
  --output speech.mp3
```

### Example: List Voices

```bash
# List all available voices
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/audio/voices

# List with OpenAI format
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/audio/voices | jq
```

## 🎤 Voice Management

### Using OpenAI-Compatible Voices

The API includes 6 OpenAI-compatible voice mappings:
- `alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `shimmer`

### Using Custom Voices

Simply place audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.m4a`, etc.) in your `VOICES_DIR` and restart the server. All files are automatically loaded as voice presets!

```bash
# Add a custom voice
cp my_voice.wav /path/to/voices/custom_voice.wav
# Restart server - voice is now available!
```

### Direct Voice Usage

You can use any voice name directly in API requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "input": "Testing custom voice",
    "voice": "custom_voice",
    "response_format": "wav"
  }'
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key environment variables (see `env.example` for full list):

```bash
# Model Configuration
VIBEVOICE_MODEL_PATH=microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5B  # or local path
VIBEVOICE_DEVICE=cuda                           # cuda, cpu, or mps
VIBEVOICE_INFERENCE_STEPS=10                    # 5-50, higher = better quality

# Voice Configuration
VOICES_DIR=demo/voices                           # Directory with voice files

# API Configuration
API_PORT=8001
API_CORS_ORIGINS=*

# Generation Defaults
DEFAULT_CFG_SCALE=1.3                            # 1.0-3.0
DEFAULT_RESPONSE_FORMAT=mp3
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Docker is the **recommended and preferred** deployment method. It provides:
- ✅ Consistent environment across all systems
- ✅ No dependency conflicts
- ✅ Easy GPU configuration
- ✅ Production-ready setup
- ✅ Simplified updates and maintenance

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU support)
- NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (for 1.5B model) or 16GB+ (for Large model)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp docker-env.example .env
# Edit .env - set VOICES_DIR to your voice files path

# Build and run
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

See [DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md](DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md) for complete Docker deployment guide.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Language Support**: Primarily English and Chinese. Other languages may produce unexpected results.
- **Non-Speech Audio**: The model focuses on speech synthesis and may generate background music or sounds spontaneously.
- **Commercial Use**: This model is intended for research and development. Test thoroughly before production use.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Check GPU availability: `nvidia-smi`
- Verify Python version: `python3 --version` (should be 3.12)
- Check dependencies: `pip list | grep torch`

### Out of memory errors
- Use smaller model: `VIBEVOICE_MODEL_PATH=microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5B`
- Reduce inference steps: `VIBEVOICE_INFERENCE_STEPS=5`
- Use CPU mode: `VIBEVOICE_DEVICE=cpu` (much slower)

### Voice not found errors
- Verify `VOICES_DIR` path in `.env`
- Check file permissions
- Ensure audio files are in supported formats
